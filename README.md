# Etch-a-Sketch 🎨

A simple web-based Etch-a-Sketch project built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Users can draw on a grid by hovering their mouse over cells, which progressively darken with each pass.  
The grid can be reset at any time with the **Reset** button.

## Features ✨
- 🖌️ Interactive grid drawing (hover to draw).  
- 🌑 Cells progressively darken on multiple hovers (not yet reaching full black).  
- 🔄 Reset button to clear and regenerate the grid.  
- 📏 Adjustable grid size (based on prompt).

## How It Works ⚙️
1. Each grid cell starts as **white**.  
2. On hover, its opacity increases step by step, giving a darkening effect.  
3. Repeated hovering continues to shade the cell darker.  
4. Reset button clears the grid and starts fresh.
